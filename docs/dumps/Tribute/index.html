        <ul>
            <li>The first humans lived within families, wich later created groups together. The alpha males became leader, because there were the strongest animal. First time (probably) in human history, when somebody was picked out from the collective</li>
            <li>Groups created clans and elected new leaders for each and one for ruling them all. As we go forward in time and population grow, the leading cast expands with new layers, while the non-leaders simply became the working class.</li>
            <li>When the first empires emerged, high rulers like Pharaoh or King opened up the treasury for collecting resources for the poeple and.</li>
            <li>At this point leaders was still a crucial part of the collective, because they were respected like gods, wich even hold until the last kings in the late middle-ages.</li>
            <li>Things strated to change, when feudalism became the new popular system in the west. Where later individualism have born.</li>
            <li>At first, it supposed to give every worker a chance for a safer living on their "own" land</li>
